# Data Science projects by Diego Murillo
This is my Data Science and Machine Learning collection. Since I am business-related undergraduate student, I am really interested in show how Machine Learning can solve real-world business problems very well.
The projects stored in this repository are ordered by industry or field. I am always learning Machine Learning for my own, so you can expect updates in the existing ones in a regular basis. Also I will add new projects as soon as I could.

## Marketing
## Prediction of the Effectiveness of a Marketing Campaign using a Cost-Sensitive Decision Tree
This project aims to predict the effectiveness of a marketing campaign of a Portugese bank. The marketing campaing is a phone call one (telemarketing). Essentially, an operator makes a phone to a client and then the operator ask to him/her if would like to suscribe to a product (bank term deposit). The anwser is a binary option (yes or no). If we can predict this event, we will save money and man-hours effort just calling to the ones with at least a acceptable/high probabilty of suscribtion. Also we can identify the most correlated features with this event, and using the knowledege for improving operational efficiency.

## Finance

## Real Estate Valuation with Bagging and AdaBoost

The present projet aims to predict the house prices at the Taiwan Market. Given features as house ages, the number of convenience stores in the living circle and the distance to the nearest MRT (Mass Rapid Transist aka Public Transportation), the goal is predict the house price (measured as house price per unit area). Using Machine Learning models in Real State Valuation problems has a clear business impact: we can advice aspiring buyers for pay the right price, and on the other hand, adivicing sellers for receive and adequate price that macht with their interests.

## Healthcare

## Prediction of Hospital Readmission of Diabetic Patients through a Random Forest Classifier

This project aims to predict the readmission of diabetic patients at U.S Hospitals. The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. Readmission is a measurement that is correlated with quality in hospitals. The more readmission rate, the less score in quality (at least in U.S). Moreover, low quality equals serious penalizations to hospitals. Therefore, if we could identify the patients with high probability of being readmitted, we could create interventions to provide additional assistance in order to avoid future readmission. In this way, we improve quality and save cost for penalties.
