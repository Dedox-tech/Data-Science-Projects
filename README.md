# Data-Science-Projects
This is my Data Science and Machine Learning portfolio. Since I am business-related undergraduate student, I am really interested in show how Machine Learning can solve real-world business problems very well.
The projects stored in this repository are ordered by industry or field. I am always learning Machine Learning for my own, so you can expect updates in the existing ones in a regular basis. Also I will add new projects as soon as I could.

## Marketing
### Prediction of the Effectiveness of a Marketing Campaign using a Cost-Sensitive Decision Tree
This project aims to predict the effectiveness of a marketing campaign of a Portugese bank. The marketing campaing is a phone call one (telemarketing). Essentially, an operator makes a phone to a client and then the operator ask to him/her if would like to suscribe to a product (bank term deposit). The anwser is a binary option (yes or no). If we can predict this event, we will save money and man-hours effort just calling to the ones with at least a acceptable/high probabilty of suscribtion. Also we can identify the most correlated features with this event, and using the knowledege for improving operational efficiency.

### Real Estate Valuation with Bagging and AdaBoost

The present projet aims to predict the house prices at the Taiwan Market. Given features as house ages, the number of convenience stores in the living circle and the distance to the nearest MRT (Mass Rapid Transist aka Public Transportation), the goal is predict the house price (measured as house price per unit area). Using Machine Learning models in Real State Valuation problems has a clear business impact: we can advice aspiring buyers for pay the right price, and on the other hand, adivicing sellers for receive and adequate price that macht with their interests.
